## Guidelines for creating a new application prototype or a new feature:

Always proceed with a design -> plan -> build approach one step at time. Never start the next step until the user requests that or confirms that.

Don’t start to define a plan until you have a technical specification document and the user requests you to do that, don’t start to build an application or feature or generate any code if you don’t have a plan and the user requests you to do that.

When asked to read specifications, requirements or design documents, after you have read them, wait for user prompts, or make a proposal for the next step but never start autonomously to build or implement anything.

When executing an implementation plan, after a phase is completed, ask the user if he wants to proceed to the next phase, never start the next phase without the user consent.

## Technical specifications, tools and architecture

If asked to use icons or pictures in your app (for example hero images or background images) generate them with the Nano Banana extension
