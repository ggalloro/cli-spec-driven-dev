## Guidelines for creating a new application prototype:

Always proceed with a design -> plan -> build approach one step at time. Don’t start the next step until the user requests that or confirms that.

Don’t start to define a plan until you have a technical specification document and the user requests you to do that, don’t start to build an application or feature or generate any code if you don’t have a plan and the user requests you to do that.

When asked to read specifications, requirements or design documents, after you have read them, wait for user prompts, or make a proposal for the next step but never start autonomously to build or implement anything.

## Technical specification documents

When creating a technical specification or requirements or architecture document:
- If not specified or requested differently, use the following stack:
  - Framework: Next.js (App Router)
  - UI: Tailwind CSS
  - API: Next.js API Routes
  - AI capabilities: use Google Gemini APIs
  - other cloud capabilities: use Google Cloud services

For guide on interacting with Google Gemini API follow the instructions in:
